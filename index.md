<p>Our site will use the grubhub page as a starting point for our app.  We feel that this page has many of the charactistics that we are looking for, such as the clean design, icons for navigation, and large high quality pictures.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>There are many restaurant review sites (i.e. Yelp), but students often crave a specific food item rather than a genre or restaurant.</p> 
<p>Hangry Fix is a way for UHM students to publicize, rate, and search for specific food items. Ratings will revolve around food items rather than overall restaurant quality, service, etc.</p>
<p>Users can also allow email and SMS notifications on their account on new locations for selected foods.</p>

<h2>The App</h2>
<h4>Landing Page</h4>
<p>The landing page will displays recent food items and their ratings, and it will also explain the purpose and mission of the site.  To prevent hangryness. Users can log in, register, and do a quick search of the foods or reviews.</p>
<h4>Login Page</h4>
<p>Students can create an account and login in order to add new food items and reviews.</p>
<h4>User Page</h4>
<p>Users have a personalized page that contains user specific data.  They can view their recent searches, foods that they have added to the database, as well as edit & delete previous reviews.  Students can select their favorite types of foods and can see suggestions for new reviews or foods that are connected to a category that they have favorited.
</p>
<h4>Add Food Page</h4>

<h4>Add Review Page</h4>
