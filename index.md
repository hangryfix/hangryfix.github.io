<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>There are many restaurant review sites (i.e. Yelp), but students often crave a specific food item rather than a genre or restaurant.</p> 
<p>Hangry Fix is a way for UHM students to publicize, rate, and search for specific food items. Ratings will revolve around food items rather than overall restaurant quality, service, etc.</p>
<p>Users can also allow email and SMS notifications on their account on new locations for selected foods.</p>
